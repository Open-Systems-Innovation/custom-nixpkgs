# Custom Nixpkgs for OSI 

This repository contains Nix packages used internally at OSI and not available on nixpkgs. These packages are not merged with nixpkgs because:
 1. They are only useful for very specific projects (e.g. a specific compilation of a library)
 2. They are only used in the internal work flow of OSI.
